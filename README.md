## Usage

**Select a View:**  
Choose Annual, Monthly, Weekly, or Daily view using the buttons at the top of the page.

**Period Navigation:**  
Use the left (Â«) and right (Â») arrows in the header to navigate between periods (month, week, day, or year). The header displays the current period (e.g., "March 2023", "Week: 03/19/2023 - 03/25/2023", "Tuesday, March 21, 2023", or "2023").

**Manage Events:**

- **Add Event:**  
  Click on any day cell to open the modal. Fill in the event details and click **Save Event**.

- **Edit/Delete Event:**  
  Click an existing event to open the modal in edit mode. Modify the details and click **Save Event** to update, or click **Delete** to remove the event.

**Data Persistence:**

- **Automatic:**  
  Events are automatically saved in Local Storage to prevent data loss on refresh.
  
- **Manual:**  
  Use the **File** menu (always visible in the navbar) to export events as a JSON file or import events from an existing file.
